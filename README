This package provides line numbers on paragraphs.  After TeX has
broken a paragraph into lines there will be line numbers attached to
them, with the possibility to make references through the LaTeX \ref,
\pageref cross reference mechanism.

Take the style-file `lineno.sty', and feed it to a unix shell, this
will produce the source documentation.  If you have neither UNIX nor
AWK, you may need to download the extracted documentation source as
well `lineno.tex'

    csh> source ./lineo.sty
    sh>  . ./lineno.sty

Please ignore the error message at the beginning about the iffalse.
After LaTeX run the document four times,  print the resulting
`lineno.dvi'.  You will need LaTeX2e.  


Since version v2.00, numbering only one in five lines and switching
the linenumbers from left to right side of the page in twoside mode is
supported.

Since version 2.04, lineno.sty defines a wrapper environment for
display math.

   \begin{linenomath}
      $$ any kind of display math $$
   \end{linenomath}

which should solve the problem to get linenumbers before displays.
Line numbers on he display itself are optional.

There are some additions to lineno.sty:
   
  ilineno.sty:   Linenumbers in internal vertical mode, like in \parbox
                 or \table.   

  mlineno.sty:   Redefine display math environments, to make lineno
                 work before displays.

  numquote.sty:  Defines quote and quotation environments with
                 linenumbers, with the numbers indented together with
                 the quoted text.
