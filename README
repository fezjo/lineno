This LaTeX2e package provides line numbers on paragraphs.  After
TeX has broken a paragraph into lines there will be line numbers
attached to them, with the possibility to make references through the
LaTeX \ref, \pageref cross reference mechanism.

Take the style-file `lineno.sty', and feed it to a unix shell, this will
produce the documentation.  If you have neither UNIX nor AWK, you may need
to download the extracted documentation source as well `lineno.tex'

    csh> source ./lineo.sty

please ignore the error message at the beginning about the iffalse.
After LaTeX run the document four times,  print the resulting
`lineno.dvi'.  You will need LaTeX2e.  

The new version v2.00 supports numbering only one in five lines and
switching the linenumbers from left to right side of the page in twoside
mode.

There are two new additions to lineno.sty:
   
  ilineno.sty:   linenumbers in internal vertical mode, like in \parbox
                 or \table.   

  numquote.sty:  defines quote and quotation environments with
                 linenumbers, with the numbers indented together with
                 the quoted text. 

Please have a look at a similar work of Michal Jaegermann and James
Fortune:
