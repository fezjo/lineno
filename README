                      lineno.sty  v3.03

     $Id: README,v 3.3 2000/07/02 02:35:47 stephan Exp $

The LaTeX package lineno.sty provides line numbers on paragraphs.
After TeX has broken a paragraph into lines there will be line numbers
attached to them, with the possibility to make references through the
LaTeX \ref, \pageref cross reference mechanism.

Files:

   README        This file.
   COPYING       The LPPL header.
   lineno.sty    The package itself, ready to use.
   lineno.tex    The source documentation.
   ulineno.tex   The pathetic attempt of a users manual.
   *.sty         Obsoleted extension packages.

Compatibility with other packages:

   wrapfig.sty   works since v2.05

   multicol.sty  works partly since 3.02.  
                 Do NOT use \linelabel.  Do NOT put a multicol in
                 internal vertical mode {table}, {figure}, etc.

   hyperref.sty  \ref to a \linelabel works since v3.03, with
                 [hyperref] option.


To print the documented source:

   Take the style-file `lineno.sty', and feed it to a Un*x shell.  (Or
   download the extracted source documentation `lineno.tex'.)

      csh> source ./lineno.sty
      sh>  . ./lineno.sty

   (Please ignore the error message at the beginning about the iffalse.)
