The LaTeX package lineno.sty provides line numbers on paragraphs.
After TeX has broken a paragraph into lines there will be line numbers
attached to them, with the possibility to make references through the
LaTeX \ref, \pageref cross reference mechanism.

The users manual is ulineno.tex.

There are some extensions to lineno.sty:
   
  ilineno.sty:   Line numbers in internal vertical mode, like in a \parbox
                 or \table.   

  mlineno.sty:   Line numbers with display math: Redefine
                 display math environments, to automatically wrap
                 the standard display math environments into
                 {linenomath}.

  rlineno.sty:   Refer to a line number with an offset, e.g., 
                   \lineref[1]{foo}
                 referes to the line after the one labeled foo.  This is
                 useful if the line that you want to refer to cannot be
                 labeled, like in a display math.

  numquote.sty:  Defines quote and quotation environments with
                 linenumbers, with the numbers indented together with
                 the quoted text. 

  bframe.sty:    Draw a frame around some text, even across page
                 breaks. Does not close the frame at page breaks, yet.

  itemrule.sty:  Draw a rule down from the bullet next to an itemized
                 item. 


To print the documented soure:

Take the style-file `lineno.sty', and feed it to a unix shell.  This
will produce the source documentation.  (If you have neither UNIX nor
AWK, you may need to download the extracted documentation source
`lineno.tex'.)

    csh> source ./lineno.sty
    sh>  . ./lineno.sty

Please ignore the error message at the beginning about the iffalse.
After LaTeX run the document four times,  print the resulting
`lineno.dvi'.
