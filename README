The LaTeX package lineno.sty provides line numbers on paragraphs.
After TeX has broken a paragraph into lines there will be line numbers
attached to them, with the possibility to make references through the
LaTeX \ref, \pageref cross reference mechanism.

Changes:
   1999-03-02 SIB: Added LPPL License

Todo:
   Include all those extensions into the main source.
   Find and Fix that \footnote bug.



The users manual is ulineno.tex.

There are some extensions to lineno.sty:
   
  ilineno.sty:   Line numbers in internal vertical mode, like in a \parbox
                 or \table.   

  mlineno.sty:   Line numbers with display math: Redefine
                 display math environments, to automatically wrap
                 the standard display math environments into
                 {linenomath}.

  rlineno.sty:   Refer to a line number with an offset, e.g., 
                   \lineref[1]{foo}
                 referes to the line after the one labeled foo.  This is
                 useful if the line that you want to refer to cannot be
                 labeled, like in a display math.

  numquote.sty:  Defines quote and quotation environments with
                 linenumbers, with the numbers indented together with
                 the quoted text. 

  bframe.sty:    Draw a frame around some text, even across page
                 breaks. Does not close the frame at page breaks, yet.

  itemrule.sty:  Draw a rule down from the bullet next to an itemized
                 item. 


To print the documented soure:

Take the style-file `lineno.sty', and feed it to a unix shell.  This
will produce the source documentation.  (If you have neither UNIX nor
AWK, you may need to download the extracted documentation source
`lineno.tex'.)

    csh> source ./lineno.sty
    sh>  . ./lineno.sty

Please ignore the error message at the beginning about the iffalse.
After LaTeX run the document four times,  print the resulting
`lineno.dvi'.
