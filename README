The LaTeX package lineno.sty provides line numbers on paragraphs.
After TeX has broken a paragraph into lines there will be line numbers
attached to them, with the possibility to make references through the
LaTeX \ref, \pageref cross reference mechanism.

NEW: I wrote a users manual `ulineno.tex'.

Since version v2.00, numbering only one in five lines and switching
the linenumbers from left to right side of the page in twoside mode is
supported.

Since version 2.04, lineno.sty defines a wrapper environment for
display math.

   \begin{linenomath}
      $$ any kind of display math $$
   \end{linenomath}

which should solve the problem to get linenumbers before displays.
Line numbers on he display itself are optional.

There are some additions to lineno.sty:
   
  ilineno.sty:   Line numbers in internal vertical mode, like in a \parbox
                 or \table.   

  mlineno.sty:   Line numbers with display math: Redefine
                 display math environments, to automatically wrap
                 the standard display math environments into
                 {linenomath}.

  numquote.sty:  Defines quote and quotation environments with
                 linenumbers, with the numbers indented together with
                 the quoted text. 

  bframe.sty:    Draw a frame around some text, even across page
                 breaks. Does not close the frame at page breaks, yet.

  itemrule.sty:  Draw a rule down from the bullet next to an itemized
                 item. 


To print the documented soure:

Take the style-file `lineno.sty', and feed it to a unix shell, this
will produce the source documentation.  (If you have neither UNIX nor
AWK, you may need to download the extracted documentation source
`lineno.tex' instead.)

    csh> source ./lineo.sty
    sh>  . ./lineno.sty

Please ignore the error message at the beginning about the iffalse.
After LaTeX run the document four times,  print the resulting
`lineno.dvi'.  You will need LaTeX2e.
